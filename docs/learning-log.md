# ðŸ“š Learning Log â€“ Career Growth Project

A running log of what Iâ€™m doing, learning, and building for my personal growth project.

## âœ… Sprint 0 â€“ Kickoff (Sun 29 Jun)

- Created GitHub repo: `openwell-dashboard`
- Created `dev` branch for development work
- Set up `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to configure the development environment
- Pushed everything to GitHub

**Reflection:**  
I now understand that most projects start by creating a repo. Iâ€™m using a `dev` branch to keep work separate from `main`.  
I still donâ€™t fully understand what a devcontainer does, but I know it sets up the tools and versions Iâ€™ll need automatically â€” even if I open this project on another machine later.

- [ ] Take the quiz on supervised learning and loss functions

**Reflection:**  
(Iâ€™ll come back and fill this out after Mondayâ€™s course block.)
