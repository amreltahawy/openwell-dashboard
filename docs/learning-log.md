# 📚 Learning Log – Career Growth Project

A running log of what I’m doing, learning, and building for my personal growth project.

---

## ✅ Sprint 0 – Kickoff (Sun 29 Jun)

- Created GitHub repo: `openwell-dashboard`
- Created `dev` branch for development work
- Set up `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to configure the development environment
- Pushed everything to GitHub

**Reflection:**  
I now understand that most projects start by creating a repo. I’m using a `dev` branch to keep work separate from `main`.  
I still don’t fully understand what a devcontainer does, but I know it sets up the tools and versions I’ll need automatically — even if I open this project on another machine later.

## 🧠 ML Course: Week 1 – Introduction to ML (Mon 1 Jul)

- [ ] Watch Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization, Course 1, Week 1
- [ ] Take the quiz on supervised learning and loss functions

**Reflection:**  
(I’ll come back and fill this out after Monday’s course block.)

## 🚧 Upcoming Sprints

| Sprint | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Sprint 1 | Use Terraform to deploy Azure RG, Static Web App, and Key Vault |
| Sprint 2 | Scaffold backend API with FastAPI |
| Sprint 3 | Add Docker support and deploy to Azure Container Apps |
| Sprint 4 | Train & deploy ML model using Azure ML |
| Sprint 5 | Create a React frontend that calls the backend |
| Sprint 6 | Add anomaly detection logic |
| Sprint 7 | Add monitoring and finish dashboard |

### 🧠 How this connects to my project:

- I will use a simple supervised model (e.g. Prophet or XGBoost) for production forecasting.
- The ML model will be trained on synthetic CSV data and deployed to Azure ML.
- The FastAPI backend will call the ML endpoint, and the React frontend will display the result.
- My learning helps me understand how that model makes predictions and what “good” accuracy means.
